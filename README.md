# Shortest path vs. optimal path visualization 
_or:_  *Is the IPO-office cut off the UMass campus?*

## The idea
The idea for this small project was genereated while I walked across the UMas-Campus realizing that there are some spots which are near by map but far if you actually walk there. I tried to find out this places algorithmically by comparing the shortest paths to the actual walking distances. Enjoy the plots

## What is it about
I tried to visually highlight spots on a map which are _difficult to reach_. In this context I mean by difficult to reach that you have to make a longer detour compared to other spots which are similarly far away.

## Some quick results
